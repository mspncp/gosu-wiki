#summary List of supported audio formats per platform

= Supported Audio Formats =

This list is populated using the semi-automated script from `trunk/feature_tests/audio_formats.rb`. It is important to note that many container formats, such as WAV or OGG, can contain several types of audio data. Recommended formats are Ogg Vorbis and PCM WAV, which are the most usual combinations.

OSÂ X refers to both Macs and iPhones/iPods. I only tested the CAF formats because they are popular on the iPhone.

*Note:* Sound in my Ubuntu VM (VMware Fusion) is currently broken, so I don't know if all formats actually sound right. At least those are the ones that didn't throw an exception upon loading on Ubuntu 9.10 with a basic Gosu install.
