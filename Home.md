# Installation

This depends on your operating system:

* [[Getting Started on OS X]]
* [[Getting Started on Windows]]
* [[Getting Started on Linux]]
* [[Getting Started on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)]]

# Tutorials

There is both a [[Ruby Tutorial]] and a [[C++ Tutorial]].

## Translations of the Ruby Tuturial

Beware: These translations are sometimes **outdated**. It is best to read them side-by-side with the English [[Ruby Tutorial]].

* [*Traditional Chinese* translation by poga][tutorial.zh]
* [*Spanish* translation by ladybenko][tutorial.es]

# Ruby Game Packaging

Since Ruby is not a compiled language, it may not be obvious how to release games written in it to the public. For instructions see either [[Ruby Packaging on OS X]] or [[Ruby Packaging on Windows]].

# Further Inspiration

There are many games you can take a look at in the [Gosu Showcase board][showcase], and even more useful libraries to use with Gosu in the [Extending Gosu board][extend]!
