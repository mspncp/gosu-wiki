This Wiki is in the process of being converted from Google Code's wiki format to Markdown. When it is finished, this home page shall be merged with the main README.txt in the project root.

## Installation

Depending on your operating system, see [[Getting Started on OS X]], [[Getting Started on Windows]] or [[Getting Started on Linux]].

## Tutorial

Consult either the [[Ruby Tutorial]] or the [[C++ Tutorial]].

### Translated Tutorials (Ruby)

## Reference

[Ruby reference with live search](http://www.libgosu.org/rdoc/), [C++ reference generated by doxygen](http://www.libgosu.org/cpp/)

## Ruby Game Packaging

Since Ruby is not a compiled language, it may not be obvious how to release games written in it to the public. For instructions see either [[Ruby Packaging on OS X]] or [[Ruby Packaging on Windows]].

## Further Inspiration

There are many games you can take a look at in the [Gosu Showcase board](http://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/board_show.pl?bid=2), and even more useful libraries to use with Gosu in the [Extending Gosu board](http://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/board_show.pl?bid=4)!
