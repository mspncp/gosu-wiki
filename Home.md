# Ruby Game Packaging

Since Ruby is not a compiled language, it may not be obvious how to release games written in it to the public. For instructions see either [[Ruby Packaging on OS X]] or [[Ruby Packaging on Windows]].

# Further Inspiration

There are many games you can take a look at in the [Gosu Showcase board][showcase], and even more useful libraries to use with Gosu in the [Extending Gosu board][extend]!
