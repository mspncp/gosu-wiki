== Also as rdoc ==

This page will continue to offer an at-a-glance overview over Gosu's Ruby interface. However, http://www.libgosu.org/rdoc/ offers a more detailed reference from now on.

== Common arguments ==
  * *Color shortcut:* Whenever a function expects a Gosu::Color value, a 0xAARRGGBB integer can be supplied instead.
  * *Additive drawing:* Valid mode parameters for drawing functions are :default and :additive.
  * *RMagick users:* Magick::Image instances can be passed instead of filenames to Image.new and Image.load_tiles!

== class Gosu::Color ==
  * `initialize(argb)`: argb is a 0xAARRGGBB integer.
  * `initialize(a, r, g, b)`
  * `alpha`
  * `alpha=`
  * `red`
  * `red=`
  * `green`
  * `green=`
  * `blue`
  * `blue=`
  * `hue`
  * `hue=`
  * `saturation`
  * `saturation=`
  * `value`
  * `value=`
  * `self.from_hsv(h, s, v)`: converts a HSV triple into a color. Same as from_ahsv with alpha set to 255.
  * `self.from_ahsv(a, h, s, v)`: converts a HSV triple into a color, with a given alpha. Ranges: alpha from 0..255, h from 0..360, s from 0..1, v from 0..1.

== class Gosu::Font ==
  * `initialize(window, font_name, height)`: font_name can either be the name of a system font, or a filename (must contain '/', does not work on Linux yet). height is the height of the font, in pixels.
  * `height`
  * `text_width(text, factor_x=1)`: Returns the width in pixels the given text would span.
  * `draw(text, x, y, z, factor_x=1, factor_y=1, color=0xffffffff, mode=:default)`
  * `draw_rel(text, x, y, z, rel_x, rel_y, factor_x=1, factor_y=1, color=0xffffffff, mode=:default)`: If relX is 0.0, the text will be to the right of x, if it is 1.0, the text will be to the left of x, if it is 0.5, it will be centered on x. Of course, all real numbers are possible values. The same applies to relY.
  * `draw_rot(text, x, y, z, angle, factor_x=1, factor_y=1, color=0xffffffff, mode=:default)`: Same as `draw` but rotated at the top left corner.

== class Gosu::Image ==
  * `initialize(window, filename_or_rmagick_image, tileable, [srcX, srcY, srcWidth, srcHeight])`
  * `width`
  * `height`
  * `draw(x, y, z, factor_x=1, factor_y=1, color=0xffffffff, mode=:default)`
  * `draw_rot(x, y, z, angle, center_x=0.5, center_y=0.5, factor_x=1, factor_y=1, color=0xffffffff, mode=:default)`: center_x Relative horizontal position of the rotation center on the image. 0 is the left border, 1 is the right border, 0.5 is the center (and default)â€”the same applies to center_y, respectively.
  * `draw_as_quad(x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, x3, y3, c3, x4, y4, c4, z, mode=:default)`: Like Window#draw_quad, but with this texture instead of a solid color. Can be used to implement advanced, non-rectangular drawing techniques.
  * `self.from_text(window, text, font_name, font_height)`: Creates a line of text. font_name can either be the name of a system font, or a filename (must contain '/').
  * `self.from_text(window, text, font_name, font_height, line_spacing, max_width, align)`: Creates a block of text of width max_width. Each line will take font_height + line_spacing pixels of vertical space.`: align must be one of :left, :right, :center oder :justify. : font_name can either be the name of a system font, or a filename (must contain '/', does not work on Linux yet).
  * `self.load_tiles(window, filename_or_rmagick_image, tile_width, tile_height, tileable)`: tile_width can either be the width of one tile in pixels or the number of columns multiplied by -1. tile_height is its vertical equivalent
  * `gl_tex_info`: See examples/OpenGLIntegration.rb.

== class Gosu::Sample ==
  * `initialize(window, filename)`
  * `play(vol=1, speed=1, looping=false)`: See play_pan. Returns a `SampleInstance`.
  * `play_pan(pan=0, vol=1, speed=1, looping=false)`: pan can be anything from -1.0 (left) to 1.0 (right). vol can be anything from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (full volume). Playback speed is only limited by FMOD's capatibilities and can accept very high or low values. Use 1.0 for normal playback speed. Returns a `SampleInstance`.

== class Gosu::SampleInstance ==
  * `stop`: Stops this instance of a sound being played. Calling this twice, or too late, does not do any harm. You can nil out the reference to the instance afterwards as it will be useless.
  * `pause`: Pauses this instance to be resumed afterwards. It will still keep a channel filled while paused.
  * `paused?`
  * `resume`
  * `playing?`
  * `volume=(vol)`: See Sample#play_pan.
  * `pan=(pan)`: See Sample#play_pan.
  * `speed=(speed)`: See Sample#play_pan.

== class Gosu::Song ==
  * `initialize(window, filename)`
  * `play(looping = false)`: Also used to resume paused songs.
  * `pause`
  * `paused?`
  * `stop`
  * `playing?`
  * `volume`, from 0..1.
  * `volume=(vol)`, with vol from 0..1.

== class Gosu::TextInput ==
  * `text`
  * `text=(str)`
  * `caret_pos`: Position of the caret as the index of the character that it's left to.
  * `selection_start`: If there is a selection, `selection_start` yields its beginning, using the same indexing scheme as `caret_pos`; otherwise, equal to `caret_pos`.

== class Gosu::Window ==
_Note that you should really only use on instance of this class at the same time. This might change later._
  * `initialize(width, height, fullscreen, update_interval = 16.666666)`: Note`: Having two or more windows and loading samples or songs on both of them will result in an exception. If you want to re-open your game window, make sure the old one is *really* dead.
  * `caption`
  * `caption=(str)`
  * `show`: Enters a modal loop where the Window is visible on screen and receives calls to `draw`, `update` etc.
  * `close`: Tells the window to end the current `show` loop as soon as possible.
  * `update`
  * `draw`
  * `needs_redraw?`: By default, always returns true. Override this to keep the window from redrawing itself at certain times, e.g. to implement frameskip.
  * `button_down(id)`: Called when the user presses the button with the given id.
  * `button_up(id)`: Called when the user releases the button with the given id.
  * `draw_line(x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, z=0, mode=:default)`
  * `draw_triangle(x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, x3, y3, c3, z=0, mode=:default)`
  * `draw_quad(x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2, x3, y3, c3, x4, y4, c4, z=0, mode=:default)`
  * `mouse_x`
  * `mouse_y`
  * `mouse_x=(float)`
  * `mouse_y=(float)`
  * `set_mouse_position(x, y)`: To avoid the intermediate position of calling `mouse_x=` followed by `mouse_y=`.
  * `button_down?(id)`
  * `self.button_id_to_char(id)`: Returns the character a given id stands for, or nil.
  * `self.char_to_button_id(char)`: Returns the id usually used for a character, or nil.
  * `text_input`
  * `text_input=`: Sets current text input object that builds an input string
  * `width`
  * `height`
  * `update_interval`
  * `gl do ... end`: See examples/OpenGLIntegration.rb.
  * `clip_to(x, y, w, h) do ... end`: Limits the drawing area to a given rectangle while evaluating the code inside of the block.

== Free functions (in module Gosu) ==

  * `offset_x(angle, dist)`: Returns the horizontal distance between the origin and the point to which you would get if you moved radius pixels in the direction specified by angle.

  * `offset_y(angle, dist)`: Returns the vertical distance between the origin and the point to which you would get if you moved radius pixels in the direction specified by angle.

  * `angle(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Returns the angle between two points in degrees, where 0.0 means upwards. Returns 0 if both points are equal.

  * `angle_diff(angle1, angle2)`: Returns the smallest angle that can be added to `angle1` to get to `angle2` (can be negative if counter-clockwise movement is shorter).

  * `distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Returns the distance between two points.

  * `milliseconds()`: Incrementing, possibly wrapping millisecond timer.

  * `default_font_name()`: Returns a font name that will work on any system.

  * `screen_width()`, `screen_height()`: Return the dimensions of the system's primary screen. Can be used to choose the size of your windowed resolution.

== Button IDs used by the input system (in module Gosu) ==
